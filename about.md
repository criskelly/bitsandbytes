	<h2>Bits and Bytes is changing the world by introducing elementary school kids to computer science in fun ways!</h2>
	<h3>Hands-On Learning</h3>
	<p>Using tablets, laptops, and desktops, our students are constantly learning by doing. We open each class with a short demo, then set the students off to discover the process for themselves.</p>
	<h3>Physical Activities</h3>
	<p>Experiential Education and Neuroscience show us that when we are physically engaged (that is, when our bodies are in motion), our brains are more likely to remember – and learn – the subject matter we are engaged in. Therefore, the instructors at Bits and Bytes get our students up and moving around for at least 5-10 minutes of every hour of coding. Besides, it's more fun that way!</p>
	<h3>Making Things</h3>
	<p>Perhaps the most important part of our classes is the products that our students actually produce. We don't tell them what to make (although we may make suggestions to get the creative juices flowing) – they come up with the idea, and we simply guide them in their process of discovery. In the end, the student has produced something that they are proud of, and perhaps more importantly – they have enjoyed the process of creating it!</p>
	<h3>Our Instructors</h3>
	<p>Skilled educators and developers, our staff is passionate about helping others learn to code. Because "Computer Science" has traditionally been such a scary subject for the general population, we feel that our number one job is to make sure that our students are having FUN! Of course, we expect our students to learn what they're there to learn, and produce code the same as ever – but our number one goal is to see that each student is enjoying it!</p>
